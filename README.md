How to compile library (tested NDK-r9d 64bit on OSX)
If you want to compile this library,
1. move to library/jni directory
2. run ndk-build clean
3. run ndk-build
The libraries are saved into libs/"architecture name" directory, for example libs/armeabi-v7a
Only library for armeabi-v7a architecture is compiled with the default setting.
If you want to compile for other architecture, you need change APP_ABI flag in the
library/jni/Application.mk file.

After compiling, copy or move libuvc.so and libUVCCamera.so into your project's 
libs/"architecture name" folder.

libusb and libjpeg are embeddedã€€into libuvc.so with current setting. You can also compile to
separate shared libraries but some compile/link error may occur(we have not confirmed well yet).

How to use
See sample project and/or our web site(but sorry web site is Japanese only).
This library works on at least Android 3.1 or later(API >= 12), but Android 4.0(API >= 14)
or later is better. USB host function must be required.
If you want to try on Android 3.1, you will need some modification(need to remove 
setPreviewTexture method in UVCCamera.java etc.), but we have not confirm whether the sample
project run on Android 3.1 yet.

Add some modification to the library and new sample project named "USBCameraTest2".
This new sample project demonstrate how to capture movie using frame data from UVC camera
with MediaCodec and MediaMuxer.
New sample requires Android 4.2(API>=18).
This limitation does not come from the library itself but from the limitation of 
MediaMuxer and MediaCodec#createInputSurface.
The library still works on at least Android 3.1 or later(API >= 12) and recommended
Android 4.0 or later (API >= 14).
